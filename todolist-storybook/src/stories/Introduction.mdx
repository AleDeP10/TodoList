  # Welcome to Storybook

  This workspace is designed to support seamless collaboration between <strong>designers</strong> and <strong>developers</strong>.
  Each component is documented, styled, and rendered with care — but more importantly, <em>interactive</em>.
  
  Stories are not just visual snapshots: they demonstrate real behavior, allowing you to explore how components respond to user input, edge cases, and responsive layouts.
  
  You are encouraged to explore the sidebar and dive into each component’s stories — from basic usage to advanced scenarios.
  
  Whether you're validating a design, testing a prop, or reviewing mobile behavior, Storybook is your playground.
