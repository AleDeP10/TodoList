/**
 * verifyShimActive.ts
 *
 * This script ensures that Yarn commands are executed through the local shim (`yarn.bat`)
 * and not bypassed by global Yarn, npx, or other package managers.
 *
 * It verifies that the current command was logged in `yarn-shim.log`, which is only updated
 * by the shim itself. If the command is not found, the script terminates immediately.
 *
 * This helps enforce architectural consistency and prevents silent fallback to global Yarn,
 * which may cause version mismatches, builder misdetection (e.g. Vite instead of Webpack),
 * or dependency resolution failures.
